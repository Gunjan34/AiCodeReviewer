"❌ Bad Code:\n```javascript\nfunction sum(){return a+b;}\n```\n\n🔍 Issues:\n*   ❌ Variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope.  This will result in a `ReferenceError` unless `a` and `b` are declared globally, which is bad practice.\n*   ❌ Lacks input validation. The function will throw an error if `a` or `b` are not numbers.\n*   ❌ Missing a clear function signature (what types of inputs are expected and what type of output is returned).\n*   ❌ No comments explaining the purpose of the function.\n\n\n✅ Recommended Fix:\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Adds two numbers together.\n * @param {number} a - The first number.\n * @param {number} b - The second number.\n * @returns {number} The sum of a and b.  Returns NaN if either input is not a number.\n */\nfunction sum(a, b) {\n  if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {\n    return NaN; // Or throw an error: throw new Error(\"Inputs must be numbers\");\n  }\n  return a + b;\n}\n```\n\n💡 Improvements:\n*   ✔ Added parameter declarations (`a` and `b`) to clearly define inputs.\n*   ✔ Included input validation to handle non-numeric inputs gracefully.\n*   ✔ Added a JSDoc comment to document the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.  This improves readability and maintainability.\n*   ✔ The return value of `NaN` indicates that the operation failed due to invalid input, providing a more informative result than a runtime error.  Alternatively, throwing an error could be more appropriate depending on the error handling strategy in the larger application.\n\nThis revised function is more robust, readable, and maintainable.  It follows best practices for function design in JavaScript.\n"
